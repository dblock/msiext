* Unix:

To generate the configure script, you need several auxiliary
tools.  The version numbers are minimal: later versions should
also work.

	autoconf 2.50 
	- see http://www.gnu.org/directory/autoconf.html

	automake 1.4
	- see http://www.gnu.org/directory/automake.html

	libtool 1.4
	- see http://www.gnu.org/directory/libtool.html


After checking the sources out from CVS, you need to run the script

	sh autogen.sh

from the top-level source directory (i.e. the one containing this
file).  This needs only to be done once.

* Win32:

To generate the documentation, use doc/makedox.bat. You need doxygen 
(doc generator tool), which can be found at: 
http://www.doxygen.org/
