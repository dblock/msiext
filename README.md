We take our custom actions seriously.

AppSecInc. Community MSI Extensions is a collection of MSI custom actions and WIX extensions that extend Windows installer, originally developped by [Application Security Inc.](http://www.appsecinc.com) for a large Enterprise product, and open-sourced in 2009. The project grew and continues growing incrementally implementing everything that wix didn't have out of the box. All custom actions and extensions are fully unit-tested.
