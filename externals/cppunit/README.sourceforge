		Making a SourceForge Release
		----------------------------

* create files to distribute and copy them to sourceforge

	Bump up release version in:
	 - include/cppunit/Portability.h
	 - configure.in
	 - doc/makedox.bat
	 - NEWS

	make distcheck
	make doc-dist
	scp cppunit*tar.gz <account>@cppunit.sourceforge.net:


* ftp the files to sourceforge; did this from the sourceforge
  shell account because my home machine is masqueraded (a.k.a. NATed)

	ftp upload
	cd incoming
	mput cppunit*tar.gz 


* go through the file release process: select "Admin", then
  "Edit/Add File Releases"
  - name of release is version number
  - make take 30 minutes to show up on downloads page


* update web pages; this is done on cppunit.sourceforge.net

	cd /home/groups/c/cp/cppunit
	mv htdocs htdocs-$(oldversion)
	mkdir htdocs
	cd htdocs
	tar xzf ~/cppunit-docs-$(newversion).tar.gz


* tag the CVS sources for release x.y.z

	cvs tag REL_x_y_z


* bump the version in configure.in and commit the change
