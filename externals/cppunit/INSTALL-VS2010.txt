This version builds and runs with the Visual Studio 2010 compiler with limited effort
using project file Build2010.sln.  You can build a target or set of targets directly with 
this file or use the batch file BuildVS2010.bat to run with minimal supervision.
  This functionality provided by H Brydon mailto:hbrydon@users.sourceforge.net

To run the batch file, you need to open a command line window that has the VS2010
environment properly set up.  This might already be done, depending on your VS2010
install options.  If not, click "Microsoft Visual Studio 2010" -> "Visual Studio Tools"
 -> "Visual Studio Command Prompt (2010)".  You will need to 'cd' to the directory where
BuildVS2010.bat exists and execute.

For example:
 D:\> cd \cppunitinstallarea
 D:\cppunitinstallarea> BuildVS2010.bat

Note that the MSB3073 "build errors" reported when building the 'simple_plugin' and
'hierarchy' projects are a demonstration of failed unit tests and are not actual build
errors.

Please refer to the file 'INSTALL-WIN32.txt' for details on how to use cppunit in your
environment.  The DSPlugin functionality is not needed in VS2010.
