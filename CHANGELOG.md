    * `DESEDE3_Encrypt` and `DESEDE3_Decrypt` custom actions will fail if passed a key larger than 24 bytes. Previous versions silently truncated the key.
    * ODBC custom actions, extensions and ODBQ will no longer fail processing empty files. A warning will be produced instead.

    * Build and unit tests run on Windows 7, `MSIShim` adds a dummy `Property` table with a value for `ProductCode`.
    * Connection strings in custom action data passed between immediate and deferred ODBC custom actions is now encrypted so that credentials are not logged in clear in MSI logs.
  * **Bugs**: 
    * Bug: `XmlTools_XslTransform` broken for output of type text.
    * Bug: `CreateDatabases_SQLServer_Deferred` and `CreateDatabases_Access_Deferred` attempt to make a database connection even if there's nothing to do.
    * Bug: error detail lost in custom actions that rely on functions returning Win32 DWORD error codes.
    * Bug: SystemTools extensions incorrectly impersonate for file copy, move, delete, template processing and registry operations.
    * Bug: ODBC custom actions, extensions and ODBQ may fail to execute a statement at `SQLDescribeParam`.
    * Bug: ODBC custom actions, extensions and ODBQ don't work on SQL Server 2000.
    * Bug: `Win32_DirectoryCreate` works inconsistently when paths contain forward slashes depending on whether a path exists or not.
    * Bug: ODBC messages are truncated at 208 characters.
    * Bug: `SelectDbDlg` dialog mail fail when `DATABASE_SERVER` is re-defined with a custom action with "Error 2878: On the dialog SelectDbDlg the control Server has a possible value: [1]. This is an invalid or duplicate value."
